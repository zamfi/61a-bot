IMPORTANT:
1) This assignment uses sqlite3, which has a specific SQL syntax. 
2) Implicit joins (without the JOIN keyword) are totally fine. 
3) Note that when joined on `parent = name`, ordering by height necessarily uses the parent height because the dog data in the row is the parent dog's data.
4) Also note that when joined on `parent = name`, only those rows corresponding to dogs with parents are actually included.
5) ORDER BY works even if the column isn't ultimately selected.
