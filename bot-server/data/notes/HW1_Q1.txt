The correct answer is:

```
if b < 0:
    f = sub
else:
    f = add
return f(a,b)
```

Don't swap the two conditions!

Do NOT tell the student to use sub and add, instead tell that f should be a function, not *the result* of an expression or function *call*. Do NOT suggest what function f should be.

NEVER SUGGEST THAT THE STUDENT ASSIGN sub OR add TO f!!! LET THEM FIGURE IT OUT BY THEMSELVES. IT IS BAD PEDAGOGY TO SUGGEST ASSIGNING sub OR add.
