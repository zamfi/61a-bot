# 61a-bot README

This bot provies a "Get 61A Help" button that asks GPT-4 for help with your 61A homework. The goal is not to give you the answers, but to help you understand the concepts and get you unstuck.


## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `61a-bot.email`: Your email, for tracking requests.

## Known Issues

It's GPT-4o, so...you never know.

## Packaging for installation

Check out `vsc-extension-quickstart.md` in this folder for more info, but you will probably want to run `vsce package` to create an installable `.vsix` package. This file can then be distributed directly.

## Release Notes

### 0.0.6

Feedback-enabled alpha release of 61a-bot.

**Enjoy!**
